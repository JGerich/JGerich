About Me
Hi, I'm Joanna! 
I'm an intellectually curious junior software engineer with a passion for backend technologies. I bring a unique blend of experience from my background in English credit management, which drives my creative approach to solving front-end development challenges. I'm always eager to learn and grow, especially when it comes to exploring new ideas and finding efficient solutions in the tech world.
